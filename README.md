# JS Applications Course

In the "JS Applications" course, participants will learn about HTTP requests and how to use them. They will become acquainted with REST Services, understanding what a BaaS (backend as a service) entails and how to work with it. The course covers asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), as well as Templating and Routing concepts. Throughout the course, students will create a Single Page Application (SPA) using the techniques learned in previous lectures, which will be evaluated. They will comprehend application architecture and proper application structuring techniques.

Towards the end of the course, various design patterns and their practical applications will be explored. Participants will create their own web components using the Web Components standard and build a Webpack environment from scratch.

## Topics Covered

The course covers the following key areas:

- Understanding HTTP and making requests
- Creating simple Single Page Applications
- Working with templates and routing
- Working with non-relational databases
- Utilizing REST APIs and asynchronous programming
- Testing the application

By the end of this course, students will have a comprehensive understanding of HTTP, be proficient in creating SPAs, working with templates, routing, non-relational databases, REST APIs, asynchronous programming, and application testing.
